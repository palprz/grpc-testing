Example of rRPC based on [baeldung.com](https://www.baeldung.com/grpc-introduction)

### Run locally

1. Go to the root of the project (`grpc-testing`)
2. In the terminal execute `mvn clean compile` (you should have some files in `io.github.palprz.autogenerated` folder after this step)
3. Run the main method from `GrpcServer` class
4. Run the second terminal window the main method from `GrpcClient` class

After these steps, in the terminal on the `GrpcClient` side you should see printed response.
